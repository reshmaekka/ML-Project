# ML-Project
in this project we create a house price prediction model for a company 
in this project we analyze the data, and also clean the data ,and process the data
we took 80% of data for traing and 20% data for testing
we looked for different correlations
we tried attribute combination 
we handelled the missing value using dropna,fillna ,also used imputer 
we used scikit-learn in which we used estimator, transformer,and predictions
we used feature scalling for min-max, and standarization
we create a pipeline for our dataset
now we have to select a model for company that gives less error or no error and work effectively
we evaluate the model
we use cross validation technique for better evaluation
cross validation provide mean: 3.370, and std:0.745
we saved the data , now we test the model on test data
same as cross validation technique we used linearregression,decisions and randomforest 
and we found the effective model random forest with mean: 3.370782980177516, standard deviation: 0.7459825177342253
